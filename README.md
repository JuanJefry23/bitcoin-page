# CRYPTOCURRENCY WEB PAGE ðŸ’° âœ…

-This project is a webpage where I explain what are the cryptocurrencies and some other news related to it.

-It has some special designs as the wave shape of the header, the glassmorphism of the cards and some special hover for it.

-There are the option "calculator" where it is an app which quote the price of the cryptocurrency selected accord the currency the user selected, it connects to the API of cryptocompare through FETCH API and quote accord the selected options and shows a result.

-It has a chatbot on the bottom part of the webpage for ask different questions, it was programmed with Html+Css for the design and JavaScript+Jquery for the logic part and used icons from FontAwesome.

NOTE: All the style sheets were purged using PURGECSS to make lighter the project and remove every line of code that is not in use and just add more kilobytes to the project.
